    <h1>Windows Server 2022 Homelab</h1>
    <p><strong>This page is a work in progress</strong></p>
    <p>
      This page is intended to highlight the key roles and features I have
      installed and configured on a windows server running in a VirtualBox VM.

    <h2>DHCP</h2>
    <p>I added a scope with the range 172.16.0.100-172.16.0.200<br>I left the lease duration as the default but I recognise that you would want a shorter one when assigning IP addresses to guests on a free wifi network and a longer lease for staff computers and printers.</p>

    <p>I confirmed that it was set up correctly by adding a windows 10 client machine to the domain.<br>It was assigned 172.16.0.100 by DHCP.</p>

    <h2>Active Directory</h2>
    <p>I created organisational units and added new users to them.</p>
